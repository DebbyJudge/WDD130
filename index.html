        <p>I love listening to music a lot and as well love to sing, and also train my fellow members the real way to sing.
          I also love trading online and market my goods online as well, and that's because I am a business marketer.
          I love studying my scriptures every time and most especially anytime I have a challenge with my studies. I started
          Pathway on the 7th of January this year, and Pathway has made me gain a lot and also helped me to know how I can
          achieve my goal. I really learned a lot throughout my semester.
