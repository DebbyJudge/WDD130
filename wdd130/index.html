           <p>I love listening to music alot and as well love to sing, and also train my fellow members the real way to sing.
            I also love trading online and market my goods online as well, and that's because I am a business marketer.
            I love studying my scriptures everytime and most especially anytime I have challenge with my studies. I started pathway on the 7th of January this year and pathway has made me gain alot and also help me to know how I can acheive my goal, I really learnt alot through out my semster.
           I started learing how to code during my last semster in pathway and it has been a really challenging one for me ever since then, I know and I beleive that if I could really help myself and put into practice the great things I learnt during my pathway certificate, I know fully well that i would achieve my goal of becoming a real Web Developer.
        Moreso, I came to learn about the Savior with the help of Institute, I have learnt how to move closer to God and also how to develop a sincere relationship with the Holyspirit.
